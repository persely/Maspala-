      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        At Maspala, every journey begins with trust. Born from South Africa’s roughest roads and toughest truths,
        we were built to do more than teach driving. We exist to protect futures.
        From potholes to reckless drivers, we understand the fear families carry.
        That’s why we make confidence the core of everything we do — because driving safe isn't just a skill, it’s a mindset.

        <li><strong>South African Heart</strong> — We train through real-world issues like potholes, taxi chaos, and rainy roads.</li>

      <h2>The Maspala Promise</h2>
      <p>
        We believe that honesty builds trust, and trust builds confidence. That’s why we don’t just teach…
        we mentor, we protect, we guide — until safe driving becomes second nature.
        Your child doesn’t just learn to drive — they learn to arrive alive.
