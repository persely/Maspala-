      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        We are Maspala — a sanctuary of trust on South African roads. Born from the cracks and chaos of potholes, reckless drivers, and lost lives, Maspala was founded with one vow: <strong>Drive to Arrive</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a country where traffic signs fade and road rage roars, our purpose became clear. We don't just teach driving. <strong>We sculpt confidence</strong>. We rewire fear into focus. Our mission is to earn the trust of every parent who silently prays their child returns safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re more than instructors. We are guardians of the journey. We train teens, empower women, calm elders — with a quiet elegance and expert precision that’s unmatched.
